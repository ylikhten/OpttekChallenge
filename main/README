Opttek Coding Challenge
Yanina Likhtenshteyn

To run:
	In the terminal, cd into OpttekChallenge directory and type:
		javac -d . main/Solver.java && javac -d . main/driver.java && java main.ProductionLine
	This command should work on both Linux and Windows machines.

About the solution:
	The main algorithm runs in O(n + klogn) time where n is the size of the sequence and k is 
	the number of iterations that are required to achieve a minimal production time.
	The TreeMap datastructure used to store the swap time differentials allows for quick 
	lookup (O(logn)) of the largest difference, which relates to the optimal swap at that iteration. 
	Then only the products at the swap indices and the indices adjacent to those are recalcualted 
	instead of recalculating all n swap times.
